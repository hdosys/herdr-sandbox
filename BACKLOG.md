# BACKLOG.md

Open, planned, blocked, or deferred product work only. User-visible rules belong in `PRODUCT.md`; technical decisions belong in `ARCHITECTURE.md`; workflow/tooling proposals belong in `AGENT_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

## Rules

- Keep items actionable and current.
- Remove completed or obsolete items instead of preserving history.
- Include expected verification when known.
- Do not use this file for task logs.

## Items

- Consider checksum-validated Cargo `.crate` archive seeding only after the package/Rust mirror path passes natively. Keep Cargo index/Git databases, extracted sources, installed binaries, and target outputs guest-local because Cargo exposes no supported split-cache paths and trusts existing archives without rehashing them.
- Add explicit SSH reuse and safe old-run cleanup after the first real session contract is stable; `status` and owned `down` are implemented.
- Evaluate the Windows 11 24H2+ `wsb.exe` management API as a second implementation only if it removes lifecycle complexity without dropping supported Windows 10 behavior.
- Pin and verify managed external tool versions/hashes when moving beyond the fast MVP's stable package-manager path.
